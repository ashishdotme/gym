Hold a straight bar thatâ€™s attached to the lower pulley. Keeping your elbows by your sides, curl the bar up, pause, then lower under control.

## Answer

### Common Mistakes
Avoid these errors so you get the most out of your effort an avoid strain or injury.

1. Going Too Fast
You should be spending at least two seconds for each phase of the curl, both up and down. Hold for at least a second when at maximum contraction.

Allowing Weights to Drop
At the end of each rep the weights should still be suspended rather than dropping them into the stack. Keeping the the cable (and therefore your muscles) under tension will enhance the effectiveness of the exercise.

2. Body Movement
Your forearm should be the only body part moving during this exercise. If you find yourself swaying, rounding or hollowing the back, jerking the shoulders, or moving the hips you are not stabilizing yourself well. This is a common sign that you are lifting too heavy of a weight and cheating by using momentum rather than steady contraction. If you're attempting quite a heavy weight, it's OK to position yourself with the leg on the same side forward for stability. You can even bend over in the leg forward position as long as you keep the back straight and allow all motion to come from your forearm.

3. Poor Range of Motion at Elbow
The whole function of the bicep is to move your forearm and upper arm together. If you aren't fully opening and closing your elbow you aren't working your biceps as much as you can with this exercise.
