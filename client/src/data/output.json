Hold the weights at shoulder-level, then press the weights straight up.","back":"### DUMBBELL BENCH PRESS MISTAKES\n\n1. ARCHING THE BACK\nArching the back while bench pressing classifies as cheating because it limits the range of motion and makes it easier to use momentum to press the weight upward. This, of course, decreases the effectiveness of the exercise, since the limited range of motion will reduce the number of muscle fibers recruited, so why would you want to do it?\n\nOn top of that, arching the back directly increases your risk of lower back injury, which can seriously harm your weightlifting and muscle building progress.\n\n1. LIFTING THE HEAD UP\nUnfortunately, this is another very common mistake that beginners and experienced lifters alike are guilty of. Your head, shoulder blades and butt need to be in contact with the bench all throughout the movement. Lifting your head and neck up whilst performing the motion can cause neck pain and injury and eventually result with an unappealing excessive back curvature known as kyphosis.\n\n# Form\n\n1. Feet Flat on the Floor\nYou want your glutes squeezed and contracted on that bench, too. Then tighten up your core; think about using your abs to pull your ribcage tight to your torso. That all sets the stage for a clean, aggressive bench that can help you grow a serious chest.\n\n1. Shoulder Position\n\"This is critical,\" says Samuel. \"Shoulder injuries are common on the bench, and very often, that's because of poor shoulder position.\"\n\nStart in the correct position; when the dumbbells are directly over your shoulders, thinking about driving your shoulders into the bench, and flexing your mid-back muscles. As you lower the dumbbells toward your chest, keep flexing those back muscles; it should feel like you're pulling the dumbbells to your chest.\n\nThe approach works regardless of whether you use dumbbells or barbells.\n\n3. Elbow Position\nNever let your elbows become parallel to your shoulders when you bench. Think about keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle, lower than your shoulders. This will help protect your shoulders and rotator cuffs in the long term. And that's not it.\n\n\"Think about turning the pits of your elbows toward your head,\" says Samuel. \"This will turn on your lats, and it will further protect your shoulders. And it's critical if you want to showcase a strong, potent bench press.\"\n\n4. Hand position\nWhether you're using a barbell or dumbbells, the width of your hands is a critical bit on the bench press. Your goal: Keep your forearms perpendicular to the ground for the entire life of each bench press set.\n\n\"This is key,\" says Samuel. \"If your hands get too close, you'll lose this angle, and that places more stress on the elbows.\" If your hands are too wide, there are other issues: You'll place stress on your shoulders and fail to get the aggressive chest contraction you really want.\"\n\nBut how do you find your hand position? Samuel says it's different for everyone. And the best way to do it: Start from the bottom. \"It's easy to have your forearms perpendicular to the ground at the top of each rep, but you have to maintain it at the bottom. So if you're unsure, start with an unloaded barbell or a pair of dumbbells at your chest, and find the right position that allows your forearms to be perpendicular to the ground at this point,\" says Samuel. \"Then you're good to go.\""}]
